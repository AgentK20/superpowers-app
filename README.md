# Redesigned Superpowers launcher

This is a work in progress and is not currently part of any release.  
See https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/tree/master/launcher for the current launcher.

## How to install

Clone this repository, make sure you have Node.js 4.x installed and run:

```bash
    npm install
    npm run build

    # Install Electron

For now, this redesigned launcher should only be used it with a Superpowers server running the [`new-launcher` branch](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/tree/new-launcher).
